# Addstuff.py
This module looks to define some functions for adding things

```
name = 'Addstuff'
```

Like this one, which adds two numbers
```
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

And this one, which adds three numbers

```
def add3(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z
```

Let's see if we can get these defined and loaded and callable, shall we?
